Slide 1: Title Slide

“Good morning everyone. Our topic is The Future of Programming Languages. This presentation is prepared by our team members from B.Sc Computer Science at Aditya Degree College for Women, Kakinada.”

🔹 Slide 2: Introduction

“Programming languages are the backbone of software development. Over time, they evolve to meet new needs like Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, mobile apps, and even quantum computing. In the future, programming languages will focus on speed, security, simplicity, and adaptability.”

🔹 Slide 3: Evolution of Programming Languages

“Programming languages have evolved in  generations:

First Generation – Machine code (0s and 1s).

Second Generation – Assembly language, which uses symbols instead of binary.

Third Generation – High-level languages like C, C++, Java, Python.

Fourth Generation – Domain-specific languages like SQL, MATLAB.

Fifth Generation – AI and declarative languages such as Prolog, R, and Python with AI frameworks.”

🔹 Slide 4: Current Trends

“Today, popular languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, and Rust.
The main focus areas are Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, web development, mobile apps, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.
Another important trend is the rise of open-source, community-driven languages.”

🔹 Slide 5: Key Features of Future Programming Languages

“In the future, programming languages will:

Support multiple platforms (mobile, web, cloud).

Have built-in AI integration.

Be secure and memory-safe.

Provide high performance and efficiency.

Use human-friendly syntax, close to natural language.

Support parallel and quantum computing.”

🔹 Slide 6: Languages Shaping the Future

“Some languages shaping the future are:

Python for AI, ML, and data science.

Rust for memory safety and performance.

Go (Golang) for cloud-native applications.

Kotlin for Android and cross-platform apps.

Julia for high-performance computing.

Swift for iOS and beyond.

Quantum languages like Q# and Quipper.”

🔹 Slide 7: AI-Driven Coding

“In the future, coding will be AI-assisted. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT already help developers.
This means programmers will focus more on logic and creativity rather than just writing syntax.
Also, low-code and no-code platforms will grow, but learning programming fundamentals will still be very important.”

🔹 Slide 8: Conclusion

“To conclude, programming languages will continue to evolve with technology.
The future belongs to languages that are fast, secure, and AI-ready.

As students, we must focus on adaptability and continuous learning.”
